# NPM_3-3-matrices
This practice is intended to define the numerical procedures for deriving basic color equations for color television and other systems using additive display devices. These equations are first, the normalized reference primary matrix which defines the relationship between RGB signals and CIE tristimulus values XYZ; then, the system luminance equation; and finally, the color primary transformation matrix for transforming signals from one set of reference primaries to another set of reference primaries or to a set of display primaries.
